# Motivation 🤔

As a flutter developer most of the features you build in your apps is the same and almost identical (redundant), either you are rebuilding the same thing over and over or copying and pasting them in every single app

we believe this is bad , for this reasons

- Waste of time and effort
- There are no tests
- There is no standard files architecture to follow
- no one to maintain the code after you deliver (new comers has to spend time to figure out what STATE MANAGEMENT approach you follow , localization , DI , …etc ) (so many options)
- Error handling is not easily made
- unless you don't have a very strict process to review your code, it will easily become unreadable , scattered between different files , slow , bugs 🐛
